        <p>
        I started experimenting with computer programming to varying degrees of success
        and with a variety of different languages and tools at the age of 12. I began by
        studying FreeBASIC, before moving on to HTML and CSS, before trying to jump into C++ 
        and hitting a brick wall. 
        <br>
        I continued honing my game development skills for many years after that before walking away from the craft 
        during my later years of high school and my earliest adult years. I found my love for technology again around
        the age of 21 or 22 and got into studying computers on a much deeper level than I ever had before. 
        <br>
        Though finding the free time to pursue all of my passion projects can always be a difficult thing, when I have the time 
        I love to contribute to my projects and continously learn new technologies.
